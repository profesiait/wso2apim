WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M) is a powerful platform for creating, managing, consuming, and monitoring web APIs. It combines tried and tested SOA best practices with modern day API management principles to solve a wide range of enterprise challenges associated with API provisioning, governance, and integration.

WSO2 API Manager consists of several loosely coupled modules.

    * API Publisher
    * API Developer Portal
    * API Gateway
    * API Key Manager
    * API Traffic Manager
The API publisher module allows API publishers to easily define APIs and manage them using a strong governance model that consists of well-established concepts such as, versioning and lifecycles. API consumers can use the API Developer Portal to discover published, production-ready APIs and access them in a secure and reliable manner using unique API keys. The built-in API Gateway module provides powerful tools to secure and control the load on individual APIs.

WSO2 API Manager is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [Middleware a' la carte] framework. All the major features have been developed as reusable Carbon components.
